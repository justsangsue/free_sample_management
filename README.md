1. Main table: This table contains all compound information (name, synonym, CAS No., description...) Information was scraped from company website using python. Only administrator can edit.

2. "Add New" table: Everyone can edit. Information in this table will be collected and updated to main table if compounds are new. If compound is already in main table, the compound information won't be added to main table, meanwhile the corresponding row in "Add New" will become red. A clickable button is available for information update and duplication check.
